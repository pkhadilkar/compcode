All buttons toggle the state of lamps.

Thus, they have their effect preserved only if number of button presses is
odd. We can simulate this by 1 button press or none.

We have 4 buttons. Each of them can be pressed or not pressed. Giving us
2^4  = 16 possible button press sequences. Order matters within each 
sequence. Thus, we should try permutations for buttons in a given sequence.

Now, there is one more restriction. If number of switch presses is less than
4, then we have to abide by that and should consider sequences that have
exactly that many button presses.

Subproblems:
1. 	find all subsets for {1, 2, 3, 4}. Use binary representation of numbers 1 
	to 16
2.	Find all permutations of a given set. Accept a vector / array and return
	a vector containing all possible combinations.
