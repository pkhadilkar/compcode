1: Toggle all
2: Toggle odd
3: Toggle even
4: Toggle i's where i = 3k + 1 for k >= 0
If there are even number of flips of switches, they do not affect the state of
the lamps.

Total combinations, 2 ^ 4 (all subsets of single switch presses)

Although only odd presses should be "counted", we should consider all permutations
of these switch presses, since 23 will produce a different output that 32.


Total sets = 2 ^ 16.
Permutations for each set = |S| !
Max per set permutations = 24

Hence general idea
for each subset:
	for each possible permutation of elements:
		Apply toggles
		See if final state matches given states
		Save the state
Sort and print output
